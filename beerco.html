        <h1>DISCOVERY & RESEARCH</h1>
        <p class="p-case-study">I developed a survey to learn more about how users interact with craft beer websites.  I wanted to know which features users considered important and which other websites users liked.  This would help me focus on the most important functionalities.</p>
        <p class="p-case-study" id="survey-beer-co">55% of respondents said they visit brewery websites.  For the respondents that visited brewery websites, the top reasons for doing so were viewing the tap list and upcoming events.  This gave me a better idea for what to incorporate into the MVP.</p>

        <!-- Begin competitive analysis -->
        <p class="p-case-study">I analyzed Sierra Nevada (Chico, CA) and Surly Brewing Company (Minneapolis, MN).  I chose these breweries to analyze based on:</p>
        <ol id="beer-co-comp-list-small">
          <li>Survey respondents’ favorite brewery websites</li>
          <li>Conversations with the founders of Bay View Beer Company on their vision of an effective website</li>
          <li>My own research on amazing brewery website design</li>
        </ol>
        <img id="sierranevada-interface" src="img/beer-co/sierranevada.png" alt="Sierra Nevada interface">
        <p class="p-case-study">Sierra Nevada's website is easy to navigate with a clear navigation bar and links.  The About page is well laid out in a unique timeline design.  The website uses typography well and has plenty of engaging content.  Sometimes, type can be hard to read, especially when laid over bright images.  The paragraphs do not always follow the Bringhurst rule.  An opportunity would be to make some paragraphs more readable by giving them a simpler background and creating better line length.</p>
        <img id="surly-interface" src="img/beer-co/surly.png" alt="Surly interface">
        <p class="p-case-study">Surly's dark color scheme and unique typography match its prickly, ironic brand.  Photos, such as crushed cans instead of full ones, also enhance their brand.  Social media links are readily available and call users to interact with the brewery.  Sometimes, pages become crowded with lots of high contrast colors and busy photos.  This can diminish scanability.  An opportunity would be to improve navigation by creating more empty space and reducing unnecessary content.</p>

          <p class="p-case-study">Informed by my user flows, I sketched wireframes of each page, and I transferred these sketches to Figma.  Not every Figma component matched the sketches identically, and that was okay.  There is a practical gap between what I put on paper and the grid system used on Figma.  Using a grid kept components consistently sized and sped up the process significantly.

          <h1>BRANDING AND VISUAL DESIGN</h1>
          <p class="p-case-study">In order to get a direction on the website's visual design, I spoke with the founders of Bay View Beer and a graphic designer they had hired.  Together, we created a brand vision statement:
          </p>
        </div>
        <section id="beer-co-vision-section">
          <div class="container" id="beer-co-vision-container">
              <p id="beer-co-vision">"Bay View Beer isn’t just a place to grab a drink, it’s a team of people who value heritage and tradition but aren’t afraid to blaze their own trail. It’s about breaking from the expected in the name of the craft instead of hiding behind it. At their core, Bay View Beer is about passion and they brew with a bold spirit."</p>
        </section>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <p class="p-case-study">With this vision statement in mind, we collaborated on moodboards and received logo ideas from our graphic designer.
          </p>
          <img id="beer-co-logo-ideas-1" src="img/beer-co/logo-ideas-1.jpg" alt="Logo sketches">
          <p class="p-case-study">We settled on a logo that we thought allowed for versatility and captured Bay View Beer's vision statement.  In particular, we thought the "B" was bold and original, yet traditional looking and could stand on its own.</p>
          <img id="beer-co-final-logo" src="img/beer-co/final-logo.svg" alt="Final logo vector">
          <p class="p-case-study">I followed guidance from the graphic designer on a color palette for the website.  I added white and gray to allow the other colors to stand out.</p>
          <img class="mobile" id="beer-co-colors-mobile" src="img/beer-co/colors-mobile.svg" alt="Color palette">
          <img class="large" id="beer-co-colors-large" src="img/beer-co/colors-large.svg" alt="Color palette">
          <p class="p-case-study">With input from the graphic designer, I chose all capital Trade Gothic Pro, Bold Condensed No. 20 as the brand typeface.  Trade Gothic is bold, adventurous, and spirited.  It's also readable in small chunks.  I chose Lato as the complimentary typeface for its readability and simplicity.

        <h1>HI-FI MOCKUPS & USER TESTING</h1>
        <p class="p-case-study">Using my style guide, I applied Bay View Beer's branding to the wireframes. At first, some of my pages lacked interest.   They were not enhancing Bay View's brand as much as they could have been.  I was able to add interest by using photographs taken at brewery events.

        <p class="p-case-study">One of the top takeaways of this project came in the research phase.  I learned just how important a brewery’s website is for its overall brand image, and I worked to create something unique to Bay View Beer.  I look forward to working with a team of developers to take the site live.  As the brewery grows, we will continue to add necessary improvements and features.</p>
