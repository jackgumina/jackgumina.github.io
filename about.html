        <h3>A SHORT STORY ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>After a day of work in corporate banking, I sat down with my cousin at a brewery.  She was into tarot cards and gave me a reading.  Apparently there was a “big career change” coming in my life.  Highly skeptical, yet undeniably interested, I took the bait.  I told my cousin I enjoyed my job, but I had always wanted to use more creativity in my career.  After all, I grew up playing music and making mini movies.  How could I find a way to exercise my creative muscles in my working life?  My cousin told me about her career in UX and product strategy, and how it allowed her to combine the creative with the practical.  After a thirty minute conversation, I was convinced.  Soon after I enrolled in a design apprenticeship and the rest is history.  I’m still skeptical of tarot cards, though.</p>

        <h3>LIFE TRANSLATED INTO UX</h3>
        <p>At eight years old, I began making short movies for fun.  From the countless hours I spent editing, converting files, and overlaying music, I became skilled at navigating my Mac’s OS.  As a kid, my friends and family were constantly asking me for computer help.  </p>
        <p>During college, I studied in Bordeaux, France for 5 months with over 200 students from around the world and went on a 40-day journey across Europe.  From a UX standpoint, I learned how differences in culture can affect people’s personalities, interests, and frustration points.  I also learned that while we may come from different backgrounds, our basic human qualities remain the same.  Living abroad gave me a passion for languages.  I am currently learning Spanish at an intermediate level with the goal of fluency.</p>
        <p>I have a bachelor’s degree in finance and have worked in corporate banking.  Having a business background allows me to think about every design project holistically.  I understand that design is a step in a process that goes from product strategy to development to sales.  I believe good designers recognize how their work impacts (and is impacted by) other business functions.  My business background also taught me how to work on a team in a professional setting, and how to work in time-sensitive, high pressure situations.</p>
