          <p class="p-case-study">After a day of work in corporate banking, I sat down with my cousin at a brewery. She was learning tarot cards and gave me a reading. She stated that apparently there was a “big career change” coming in my life. Highly skeptical, yet undeniably interested, I took the bait. I told my cousin I enjoyed my job, but I had always wanted to use more creativity in my career– after all, I grew up playing music and making films whenever I could. My cousin then went on to tell me about her career in UX and product strategy, and how it allowed her to combine creativity with practicality. After a couple of hours of conversation and a couple more craft beers, I was convinced. Soon after I enrolled in a design apprenticeship and the rest is history. (I would like to note that I’m still skeptical of tarot cards.)</p>

          <h3>LIFE TRANSLATED INTO UX</h3>
          <p class="p-case-study">At eight years old, I began making movies for fun and playing musical instruments.  These things made me ultra-interested in all things creative.  I often catch myself viewing this world in this way.  "What would that situation at the mall look like on screen?" or "If I wrote a song about my day today, what would it be?"  I can't help it.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="p-case-study">To really round out the cliche of a craft beer drinking designer, I also love to travel. From a UX standpoint, my travels taught me how differences in culture can affect people’s personalities, interests, and frustration points. I also learned that while we may come from different backgrounds, our basic human qualities remain the same.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="p-case-study">Before my foray into UX, I came from the world of finance and business. I'm grateful for this background because it's helped me see design holistically within an organization. I understand that design is a key step in a process that goes from product strategy to development and into our customers' hands. I believe to be a great designer I need to recognize how my work impacts (and is impacted by) other business functions.</p>
