        <p class="project-intro">People use cloud storage products to help plan events.  Google Drive to create a guestlist, Pinterest to share ideas, Dropbox to send an important PDF.  Why not use a single product to perform all of these tasks?  Event Drawer aims to be the one-stop-shop for event planning needs.</p>
      </section>

        <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
        <p>The majority of users have a hard time predicting attendance levels and feel generally disorganized while event planning.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>Event Drawer is a one-stop-shop for event planning and organization.  Users can create events (or drawers), upload or create related files within these drawers, invite contacts, and track attendance.</p>

        <h3>DISCOVERY & RESEARCH</h3>
        <p>I created a survey to learn more about potential problems users face when using cloud storage products.  I hypothesized that people use cloud storage to help with event planning, but I needed to know if an event planning product was worth pursuing.  I focused mostly on two key questions:</p>
        <ol class="big-list">
          <li>Do people use cloud storage products to help plan events?</li>
          <li>What problems do users face when planning events?</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="svg/Event Drawer/Survey Chart.svg">
        <p>Over 60% of respondents said they used cloud storage products to assist with event planning.  The two biggest problems users faced when planning events were keeping track of attendance levels and feeling generally disorganized and overwhelmed.  This survey informed me to create a product that would:</p>
        <ol class="big-list">
          <li>Allow users to track attendance</li>
          <li>Keep all event-related info in a single, easy-to-access space</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I analyzed Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pinterest, which all allow for easy file creation and collaboration.  However, users would have to get creative in their use of each product to effectively use them as event planners.  Why not provide a product that was specifically tailored to this purpose?</p>
        <img src="svg/Event Drawer/Comp Analysis.svg">
        <p>I created the following user personas:</p>
        <div class="persona">
          <h3>JAMES</h3>
          <img src="svg/Event Drawer/James.svg">
          <ul class="persona-intro">
            <li>Social young professional</li>
            <li>25 years old</li>
            <li>Madison, WI</li>
          </ul>
          <p>James often makes plans with friends on the weekends.  He makes a decent salary for a person his age, but he is by no means wealthy.  He considers himself in line with his peer group of 25 year old college grads.</p>
          <h3>MOTIVATIONS</h3>
          <p>James often attends concerts and weekend getaways with friends.  Keeping track of attendance and payments can be a nightmare, and nobody really wants to take charge.  James thinks an event planning app could help solve this.  He also wants a go-to place for photos, so his friends donâ€™t have to text him a bunch of pictures.</p>
          <h3>GOALS</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Keep track of event attendance</li>
            <li>Make sure everyone pays equal</li>
            <li>Have a go-to area for photos</li>
          </ol>
