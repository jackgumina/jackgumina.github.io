        <h3>DISCOVERY & RESEARCH</h3>
        <p class="p-case-study">I created a survey to learn more about potential problems users face when using cloud storage products.  I hypothesized that people use cloud storage to help with event planning, but I needed to know if an event planning product was worth pursuing.  I focused mostly on two key questions:</p>
        <ol class="evd-big-list">
          <li>Do people use cloud storage products to help plan events?</li>
          <li>What problems do users face when planning events?</li>

              </ul>
              <p>James often makes plans with friends on the weekends.  He makes a decent salary for a person his age, but he is by no means wealthy.  He considers himself in line with his peer group of 25 year old college grads.</p>
              <h3 class="persona-heading">MOTIVATIONS</h3>
              <p>James often attends concerts and weekend getaways with friends.  Keeping track of attendance and payments can be a nightmare, and nobody really wants to take charge.  James thinks an event planning app could help solve this.  He also wants a go-to place for photos, so his friends don’t have to text him a bunch of pictures.</p>

              <p>Gretchen has been a dental hygienist for 30 years. She has three children who are out of the house.

              <p>Gretchen has been adjusting to life without kids at home.  In order to take her mind off of it, she plans more vacations with friends.  Gretchen believes an app could be useful in keeping track of relevant documents between friends.  Right now, there is a lot of back-and-forth email, which can get overwhelming.</p>

        <p class="p-case-study">The most important user stories would allow for a single space to create, store, and share all event-related information.  They would also allow for tracking attendance.  Below are some examples of high priority user stories:

        <ul class="user-flows">
          <li>Sign Up</li>

          <p>Informed by my user flows, I sketched wireframes of each page, and I transferred these sketches to Figma.  Not every Figma component matched the sketches identically, and that was okay.  There is a practical gap between what I put on paper and the grid system used on Figma.  Using a grid kept components consistently sized and sped up the process significantly.

        </ol>
        <p class="p-case-study">Overall, users were able to complete the tasks.  However, they did offer some suggestions for improvements.<br><br></p>
        <div id="evd-buttons-size">
          <p class="p-case-study">Not all buttons were consistently sized, which sometimes confused users.  Was there a difference in importance between the large and small buttons?  Did they all function the same?  I needed to make all buttons uniform.</p>

          <h3>BRANDING AND VISUAL DESIGN</h3>
          <p class="p-case-study">One of the problems users faced when planning events was feeling stressed and overwhelmed.  I wanted to induce a feeling of happiness about the event itself, and not the stress of planning it.  I came up with four core brand adjectives:
          </p>
          <ol class="evd-big-list">
            <li>Stress-free</li>
            <li>Homey</li>
            <li>Comfortable</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="p-case-study">In line with my brand adjectives, I chose a warm color palette.
          </p>
          <img id="event-drawer-colors-mobile" src="img/EventDrawer/ColorsMobile.svg" alt="Color palette">
          <img id="event-drawer-colors-large" src="img/EventDrawer/ColorsLarge.svg" alt="Color palette">
          <p class="p-case-study">I was initally torn between two brand typefaces -- Berkshire Swash and Yeseva One.  Berkshire Swash’s curves and movement give off a sense of fun.  Yeseva One still seemed fun, but a bit more readable and sleek.  Preference testing showed me 83% of users preferred Yeseva One.
          </p>
          <div id="evd-brand-typeface">

          </div>
          <p class="p-case-study">I chose Lato as my complimentary typeface.  Lato is round enough to appear warm and friendly, but straightforward enough to be readable in large chunks.  Lato’s even line weight compliments Yeseva One’s uneven weight, yet the letter styles such as “a” and “g” remain consistent between the two.

          <p class="p-case-study">One of the biggest challenges during the visual design process was the use of color throughout the site.  I began with a mahogany background along with a cream color instead white.

          <img id="event-drawer-home-1" src="img/EventDrawer/Home1.jpg" alt="Home screen">
          <p class="p-case-study">Through preference testing and discussions with the design team, I came to the conclusion that my background was too dark.  It took focus away from the most important elements on the page, such as buttons and text.  In addition, the cream color looked dated.  I went with white instead to give the site a cleaner and more modern feel.  I also lightened the drawers.

        <h3>USER TESTING ROUND 2</h3>
        <p class="p-case-study">In my second round of usability tests, I had users complete 6 tasks:
        </p>
        <ol class="evd-big-list">
          <li>Sign up</li>
          <li>Create a new event folder or “drawer”</li>
          <li>Create a photo album and upload a photo</li>
          <li>View an event’s attendance list</li>
          <li>Navigate to the inbox and accept an invitation</li>
          <li>Sign out</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p-case-study">I also had users comment on the brand and feel of the site.  How did it make them feel?  What was the brand conveying to them?  Overall, users were able to complete each of the tasks.  They also said the brand felt fun and friendly.  However, the site was far from perfect.  Users were able to point to improvements that I may not have otherwise noticed.<br><br>
        </p>
        <div id="event-drawer-input-div">
          <p class="p-case-study">Input fields were inconsistent and too tall.  This confused users because they were unsure if some fields were buttons or not.  I needed to shorten the input fields and make them uniform.
          </p>
          <div id="evd-inputs">
            <img id="event-drawer-input-1" src="img/EventDrawer/Input1Mobile.svg" alt="Input field">
            <img id="event-drawer-input-2" src="img/EventDrawer/Input2Mobile.svg" alt="Input field">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="p-case-study">On the inbox page, users the messages looked like buttons instead of mail items in an inbox.  Also, why were some red and some white? (My idea was to have unread messages be red).
        </p>
        <img id="event-drawer-inbox-old" src="img/EventDrawer/InboxOld.jpg" alt="First inbox">
        <p class="p-case-study">I squared off these elements and reduced their vertical spacing to make them appear more like an email inbox.  I also made them white and gray instead of red in order to distinguish them from buttons.  I added icons to more clearly display which messages were read and unread.

        <h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>
        <p class="p-case-study">I had a lot of fun designing a product prototype that could help users with the stress of event planning.  Keeping users in mind throughout the entire process was essential.  Without their input, I would have missed key improvements on my initial ideas.  By listening to my users problems and concerns, I was ultimately able to create something that would be effective in making their lives a little bit easier.</p>
